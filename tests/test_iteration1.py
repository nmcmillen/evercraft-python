# def test_attack_roll20():

#### Feature: Character Can Attack

# > As a combatant I want to be able to attack other combatants
#  so that I can survive to fight another day

# - roll a 20 sided die (don't code the die)
# - roll must meet or beat opponent's armor class to hit
# - a natural roll of 20 always hits



# #### Feature: Character Can Be Damaged

# > As an attacker I want to be able to damage my enemies so that they will die and I will live

# - If attack is successful, other character takes 1 point of damage when hit
# - If a roll is a natural 20 then a critical hit is dealt and the damage is doubled
# - when hit points are 0 or fewer, the character is dead



# #### Feature: Character Has Abilities Scores

# > As a character I want to have several abilities so that I am not identical to other characters except in name

# - Abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Wisdom, Intelligence, Charisma
# - Abilities range from 1 to 20 and default to 10
# - Abilities have modifiers according to the following table
